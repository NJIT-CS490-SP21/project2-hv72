### by Hemanth Velan

## Requirements

2. `pip install requests`
3. `npm install -U flask`
4. `npm install -g heroku`
5. `npm install -U flask-cors`
6. `pip install flask-socketio`
7. `npm install`
8. `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Setup
1. Run `echo "DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true" > .env.development.local` in the project directory


## Run Application

2. Run command in another terminal, `cd` into the project directory, and run `npm run start`
3. Preview web page in browser '/'


## Deploy to Heroku
*Don't do the Heroku step for assignments, you only need to deploy for Project 2*
1. Create a Heroku app: `heroku create --buildpack heroku/python`
2. Add nodejs buildpack: `heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs`
3. Push to Heroku: `git push -f heroku milestone_1:main`

## Known Problem(s) / Future Ideas
1. A known problem is that there is no user history for this implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. To solve this problem in the future milestone, I plan on using postgresql as a database server to store the data involving user history. Which will in turn allow me to create a leaderboard about each use based on the number of wins they have.
2. Another future idea that I plan on implementing is using images instead of Xs and Os to make my Tic-Tac-Toe more unique compared to other Tic-Tac-Toe games out there. For this I plan on looking for two images of characters who are considered enemies such as: Aang and Zuko(I know that Zuko isnt his final enemy, but Zuko is more popular, and thus the better option compared to Firelord Ozai)

## Technical Issues and How I Solved Them (too many to remember them all)
1. One technical issue I ran into was with the return function in Board.js, where I was trying to return multiple divs, but for some reason it was resulting in a react element error. Which didn't make sense to me as my HTML tags made sense to me and had no isses from what I can tell. So I went to google and searched `JSX Element` and found a W3 Schools link that explained how React JSX elements work. The solution ened up being: having a div tag that encloses all my other div tags.
    Resource: https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_jsx.asp#:~:text=JSX%20allows%20us%20to%20write%20HTML%20elements%20in%20JavaScript%20and,easier%20to%20write%20React%20applications.
2. Another technical issue I ran into was with emmit and emit from socketio, where for some reason the board update was only happened at the start of each click instead of updating at the end of each click. So to help troubleshoot this issue, I had tired to mess around with prevList, and found out that prevList was where the issue was as it was updating the previous state of the board instead of the current state. So to fix this, in my emmit function, instead of sending the current board state, which still hasnt been updated, I created a separate variable to hold the correct modified board state, and emmitted it to the server isntead.
